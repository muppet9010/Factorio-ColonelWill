test-spaceship-v1-welcome=While ColonelWill is away the task is to carry out tests at home to find out why \nhis escape pods keep crashing. Each technology of the transmitted \nescape pod design is going to have to be tested in order.
test-spaceship-v1-firstStageDone=After conducting all tests no fault has been found with the Escape pod design \ntransmitted. It appears the cause for ColonelWill's crashes is an overload of \nthe system due to excessive MoarFaster. To avoid this hyperspace travel \nmust be developed for the impatient overlord NOW. You have been authorised \nto utilise biter extermination to support you in this endeavour.
test-spaceship-v1-won=Congratulations, not even ColonelWill could crash this new hyperspace travelling ship you \nhave designed for him. The overlord is pleased with your service.
