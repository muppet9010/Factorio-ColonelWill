test-spaceship-v1-welcome=While ColonelWill is away the task is to carry out tests at home to find out why \nhis escape pods keep crashing. Each technology of the transmitted \nescape pod design is going to have to be tested in order.
test-spaceship-v1-won=After conducting all tests no fault has been found with the Escape pod design \ntransmitted. It apears the cause for ColonelWill's crashes is an overload of \nthe system due to excessive MoarFaster.
